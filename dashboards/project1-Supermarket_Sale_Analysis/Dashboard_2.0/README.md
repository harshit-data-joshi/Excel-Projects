# 🛒 Supermarket Sales & Profit Dashboard – Version 2 (Excel)

Welcome! This is the second version of my interactive dashboard built using Microsoft Excel.  
It improves upon Version 1 by enhancing the design, adding KPI cards, refining data structure, and optimizing visuals for better readability.  
It continues to track sales, profit, and quantity sold across U.S. states from 2014 to 2017, while providing a cleaner and more insightful user experience.
